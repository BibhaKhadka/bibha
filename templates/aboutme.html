        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Bibha Khadka, a 20-year-old student based in Nepal. I am deeply passionate about new things and enjoy learning new skills in my spare time.</p>
        <p>Originally from Kapan, Kathmandu, I have always been inspired by the dance between chaos and order, finding beauty in the unexpected connections that emerge.. Whether it's delving into the complexities of IT or exploring the great outdoors, I find joy in seeking out new experiences and learning opportunities.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I have dedicated myself to Information and Technology. With zero years of experience in the field as I am a student. I thrive in environments that challenge me to think creatively and innovatively, pushing boundaries to achieve meaningful results.</p>
        <p>Beyond my professional endeavors, I am a firm believer in the importance of onself, kindness and growth. I strive to embody my values in action by consistently seeking opportunities to make a positive impact in both my personal and professional life. Whether it's volunteering for local causes, advocating for environmental sustainability, or simply lending a helping hand to those in need, I am committed to making a positive impact in my community and beyond.</p>
        <p>In my downtime, you can often find me immersing myself in various hobbies and interests. Whether it's losing myself in a captivating book, exploring the outdoors through hiking and photography, or honing my culinary skills by experimenting with new recipes, I relish the opportunity to unwind and recharge. I believe in the power of balance, finding harmony between work, leisure, and personal growth, allowing myself to rejuvenate and cultivate new passions along the way.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring the endless possibilities that lie ahead.</p>
